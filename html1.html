    <h1>Some features of HTML5</h1>
    <ul> <li> Improved Multimedia support - HTML5 allows for the integration of multimedia elements such as audio and
    video directly into web pages without the need for plugins like Flash.</li>
    <li> Canvas element - HTML5 introduced the < canvas > element, which allows for dynamic, interactive graphics to
    be created and manipulated within a web page.</li>
    <li>Geolocation API - HTML5 provides an API for obtaining the user's location, enabling web applications to
    offer location-based services.</li> 
    <li>Local Storage - HTML5 introduced the localStorage API, which allows for the storage of data on the user's
    device, improving performance and reducing the need for round-trips to the server.</li>
    <li> New Structural Elements -  HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as < header >, < footer >, < nav >, and
    < article > that make it easier to structure and organise content on a web page.</li>
    <li> Form Improvements - HTML5 introduced several improvements to forms, including new input types like date,
    time, and colour, as well as new attributes such as required and autofocus.</li>
     Accessibility improvements - HTML5 provides better support for accessibility, including the ability to
    provide alternative text for images and improved support for screen readers.</ul>
