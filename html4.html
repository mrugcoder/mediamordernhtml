<ul><li> Text content
Having well-structured content that includes headings, paragraphs, and lists is one of the most helpful accessibility features for users who rely on screen readers.</li>

 <li>Page layouts
Although it is possible to design a layout using nested < div > elements, it is preferable to utilise proper sectioning elements to encapsulate your main navigation (< nav >), footer (< footer >), repeated content units (< article >), and other relevant content.</li>

<li>These elements offer additional semantics to screen readers and other assistive tools, providing users with more context and information about the content they are browsing. </li>

 <li>UI controls
When referring to UI controls, these are the essential elements of web documents that users engage with, such as buttons, links, and form controls.</li>
